# Festive Tech Calendar 2022 sample application

[This article](https://www.007ffflearning.com/post/steps-for-blazor-marvel-webassembly/) describes all the steps on how to develop a Marvel Hero catalog app, using Blazor Web Assembly, and is a companion guide to the Festive Tech Calendar 2022 session I presented. This app introduces Blazor .NET development, and more specifically how to easily create a Single Page App using HTML, CSS and API calls to an external API Service at https://developer.marvel.com

As I am learning development with .NET for the first time in 47 years, and succeeding in having an actual app up-and-running, I wanted to share my experience, inspiring other readers (and viewers of the session) to learn coding as well. And maybe becoming a passionate Marvel Comics fan as myself.

I hope you enjoy the steps, feel free to contribute to this project at petender/FestiveBlazor2022live (github.com) if you want to co-learn more Blazor stuff together with me.
